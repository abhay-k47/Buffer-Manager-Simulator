# Project Proposal: Simulating Buffer Manager Strategies in C/C++ using SQLite

## Background

Buffer management is a critical component in database management systems that plays a vital role in improving the performance of database systems. Buffer management is the process of managing data that is temporarily stored in the buffer pool. The buffer manager is responsible for deciding which pages to keep in memory and which pages to evict to disk. The choice of buffer management strategy can have a significant impact on database performance. In this project, we will simulate a small buffer pool for simple join/selection queries on a few small tables using popular buffer manager strategies like LRU/MRU/CLOCK/Pinned blocks. We will compare the strategies in terms of the number of disk I/O required.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows

- To implement a small buffer pool for join/selection queries using the SQLite C library.
- To simulate different buffer management strategies like LRU/MRU/CLOCK/Pinned blocks.
- To compare the number of disk I/O required for different buffer management strategies.
- To gain practical experience in buffer management in database management systems.

## Methodology

The project will be divided into the following phases

### Phase 1: Database Design

In this phase, we will design a small database with a few tables for join/selection queries. The database should have enough data to simulate buffer management strategies effectively. We will use SQLite to create the database schema and populate it with sample data.

### Phase 2: Buffer Pool Implementation

In this phase, we will implement a buffer pool with a fixed size in C/C++ using the SQLite C library. We will use the SQLite C interface to manage the buffer pool and access the data in the database. We will also implement the necessary functions for allocating and deallocating buffer pages, reading and writing pages to disk, and managing the buffer pool state.

### Phase 3: Buffer Management Strategies

In this phase, we will implement different buffer management strategies like LRU/MRU/CLOCK/Pinned blocks. We will write the necessary code to simulate each strategy. For example, for LRU strategy, we will maintain a linked list of pages in the buffer pool, and the most recently used page will be moved to the front of the list when accessed. For MRU strategy, we will maintain a similar linked list, but the least recently used page will be moved to the front of the list when accessed. For CLOCK strategy, we will maintain a clock hand that sweeps through the buffer pool and evicts the page pointed to by the hand. For Pinned blocks strategy, we will maintain a set of pages that are not evicted from the buffer pool.

### Phase 4: Query Simulation

In this phase, we will simulate join/selection queries using the buffer pool and different buffer management strategies. We will use SQLite to execute the queries and track the number of disk I/O required for each query. We will measure the number of disk I/O operations required for each strategy and compare the results.

### Phase 5: Performance Comparison

In this phase, we will compare the number of disk I/O required for different buffer management strategies. We will analyze the results and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of each strategy. We will consider factors like buffer pool size, database size, and query complexity.

## Deliverables

A report detailing the project's background, objectives, methodology, and results.
A set of source code files for the project.
A user manual describing how to set up, configure, and use the buffer pool and buffer management strategies.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, we will have demonstrated the ability to simulate a small buffer pool and compare different buffer management strategies. This project will provide valuable experience working with buffer management in database management systems and demonstrate the use of popular buffer management strategies like LRU/MRU/CLOCK/Pinned blocks.
